The two directories are selected property outputs from the Undine tool with some notes to contextualize.

Traces within the "outs" directory are output files from Undine runs used when counting numbers of properties to find the steady state sizes and also some reset related properties.

Traces within the "save" directory are output files along the templates used when searching for known properties.  This specific set was used to take timing information.  It includes some notes about how the traces were generated.
